A packet sniffer for LAN that works on Mac OSX.

This project was created to help me learn about 802.11.
The code is a little on the messy side because I only
had a couple weeks near the end of the summer to hammer it out
before school started. A lot of the encryption techniques could
have been pulled in from external libraries, but I decided it would
be good to learn how to create them in order to get a deeper understanding.
Now and then I will go back in to refactor the code and make progress, but
my time is limited so it hasn't been making great progress.
